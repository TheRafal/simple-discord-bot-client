# Text-based Discord Bot Client

I was bored and didn't want to work on frontend so I wrote this to send some messages to my friends via bots. If I'll get bored once more, I'll probably add some new features.
The client is text-based for now, maybe I'll create some UI later. 

# Installation & Setup

## Pre-requisites

- Node.js v18

## Setting up the bot

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create `.env` file in the root directory setting up variables from `.env.example`.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm run build` to build project.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the bot.
